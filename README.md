# income_classifier

Logistic Regression algorithm trained on demographic features to classify incomes between &lt;$50,000 or >$50,000.


## about
We examined a dataset of 50,000 incomes and over 20 unique features, including occupation, nation, age, and years of experience
to determine the optimal set of parameters for our logistic regression algorithm to find the optimal local minimum that minimizes the
squared error. 

## results
See the paper excerpt of our implementation and results on the Linkedin Projects page. We designed a confusion matrix and counted the
frequency of false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives on a test dataset the algorithm wasn't originally trained on.
